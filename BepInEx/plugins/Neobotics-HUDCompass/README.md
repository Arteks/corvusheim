# HUD Compass

## Heads-Up Compass with Dynamic Map Markers for Ships, Carts & Portals

Dude, where's my boat? Never lose track of your boats, carts or portals again. A heads-up compass that includes standard pins and dynamic map markers for ships, carts, active and inactive portals on the compass and the map.

HUD Compass combines and enhances the functionality of Immersive Compass and Automatic Map Markers to bring a complete experience to location aids. (see credits below)

- The scaleable compass appears across the top of your screen.
- Toggle the compass on and off in-game.
- Dynamic pins (ships, carts, portals) are shown on the compass and the map, with or without labels. 
- Supports custom ships and carts.
- Active and inactive portals can have different colors. 
- Portal pins display the name you give them. 
- Ship labels can specify the type of ship (Karve, Longship, Raft), as well as custom ships.
- Pin types to include/exclude are configurable. 
- Pin size is relative to marker distance, with configurable limits.
- Configuration to use external images for custom compass and dynamic icon appearance. **See Notes**

## New
- Added new immersion configurations for the visiblity of HUD indoors, in fog, in mist, in combat, and while running.
- Added support for Advanced Portals from Randy Kapp (obsidian, ancient and blackmetal portals)
- Fixed (mostly) compass positioning for different resolutions. You will need to reset previous offsets (Offset (Y))

You can use Configuration Manager (or similar) mod to change the configuration without exiting the game. The configuration will reload if you make changes to the config file. 

### Credits

First and foremost, credit goes to **gdragon** for convincing me to pick up development of Immersive Compass, and for _extensive_ suggestions, testing and feedback. Without this help I would have only had half the functionality.

HUD Compass incorporates the excellent functionality of Immersive Compass by GuyDeYoYo (aka Fragnarok, with permission), which credits the original code to Aedenthorn. 

The dynamic markers extensively uses code from Automatic Map Markers - Ship & Cart from Schlangguru, who I made several attempts to contact for explicit permissions but the mod is not maintained.

I will remove this mod if either author objects. Use of the code is within the license requirements of the above mods and is included in the distribution.

### Notes
- The option to turn off the compass in dense fog or mist only applies if you are actually **in** the fog or mist. It does not turn off if other things if your field of vision are obscured.
- Fixed most issues with Compass position for different screen resolutions. Note that you still may need to make very minor changes, but not the huge offsets of the prior releases. 
- **Caveat** If you have made large ***Offset (Y)*** changes, you will need to reset them. Try starting with zero (0).
- Thanks to Cuculainn for the suggestion and the new, more visible compass graphics
- With version 1.0.2 HUD Compass can now use external images for the compass and dynamic pins. You may customize or replace these images (at your own risk), but please remember to save a copy of your custom images as they will be overwritten when new versions are deployed.
    - Version 1.0.4 changed to use external images, however, mod managers were not installing images in a Resources sub-folder.
    - Version 1.0.5 has a configuration item **Use External Images** which is set disabled by default. You can turn on use of external images, which R2Modman will install in the same folder as the mod's .dll
- Player Pin Visibility (server controlled setting) affects player pin display on both the compass and the map.
- Show My Player Pin is synced with Visible to Other Players toggle on the map. They are the same.
- An _C. Ignore / Pin Names_ entry can include leading and trailing asterisks (\*)
    - Examples:
    - "Raspberry\*" will match "Raspberry" and "Raspberry xyz" 
    - "\*Raspberry" will match "Raspberry and "abc Raspberry"
    - "\*Raspberry\*" will match "Raspberry", "Raspberry xyz" and "abc Raspberry", but only if the start or end match the entire string 
    - "\*berry" will match "Raspberry", "Blueberry" and "Cloudberry" and anything else ending in "berry" including all berries prefixed with a count (e.g. "3 Raspberry")

**Note:** Wildcard matches can be FPS 'expensive'. Whenevery possible, try to create one that includes multiple pins (i.e. the '\*berry' example above)

### Compatibility issues & defects

- HUD Compass has been tested with OdinsShipsPlus, ValheimRAFT, CustomShips, and CraftyCarts.
- It should work with any mod that adds ship or carts using the standard Ship or Vagon components.
- 'Buildable' ships and carts will show the name of their base unit, e.g. Custom Ship, Raft Base.

- If you find a compatibility issue you can post it on NexusMods. Be sure to include the mod name and version you think may be incompatible.
- If you have a bug please report it on NexusMods. If you do post a bug report, please make sure to include the following:
    - Your version of this mod
    - What you were doing, or attempting to do when it happened
    - If it's repeatable - i.e., can you duplicate it?
    - The exact behavior you observed (or didn't observe)
    - If possible, post a capture of the log file with errors (errors always begin with this mod's name) on Discord
